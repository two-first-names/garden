# Hi, I'm Joe

I'm a 'Site Reliability Engineer' and proud caretaker of a wonderful Corgi/Poodle called Peggy. When I'm not working or taking care of her, I play video games, tabletop roleplaying games, and work on projects that will never see the light of day. I am currently in the employ of the UK Government :scream:, and honestly that was one of the best decisions I made.

You can find out more [about me and how I operate](/me), what I [use](/use), and the kinds of things I am [working on](/projects) (that I want to see the light of day!).

## Experience

(No, I am not looking for work right now, but it's good to put this somewhere.)
